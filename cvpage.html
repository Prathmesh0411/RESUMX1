        <p class="writeup">CV (short for Curriculum Vitae) is the Latin word for “course of life.”
            In a nutshell, a CV is a summary of who you are as a professional, 
            including your work history, education, and skills. Done right, a CV is 
            supposed to “sell you” to potential employers and land you a job.</p>

            <h2 class="wcv">2. What’s the Difference Between a 
                CV and a Resume? </h2>
            <p class="writeup"> Technically speaking, a CV and a resume are the same 
                document. The only difference is that Americans call it 
                a "resume," while Europeans and others refer to it as a 
                CV.
                A European CV can be between two and three pages 
                long, depending on experience. A US resume is usually 
                one or two pages max.
